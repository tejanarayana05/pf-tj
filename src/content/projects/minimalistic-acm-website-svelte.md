#### **Description**

This Project is a dynamic web application built using **Svelte** and deployed on **Vercel**, designed to serve as a centralized hub for student developers and ACM chapter members. The platform focuses on delivering a lightweight, responsive, and optimized experience by leveraging Svelte’s compiler-first approach that generates highly performant JavaScript with minimal runtime overhead. Its intuitive UI and modular structure enable quick access to events, announcements, and learning resources, offering a modern digital ecosystem for academic collaboration.

#### **Objectives**

- To build a **responsive and minimal** web app for the ACM student chapter that loads fast and performs efficiently across devices.
- To apply **modern JavaScript tooling** (via Svelte and Vercel) in a real-world production context.
- To create an **easily maintainable and scalable** system with clean component structures and reusable UI blocks.
- To enhance user engagement and administrative ease through streamlined navigation and an optimized deployment pipeline.

#### **Tech Stack**

| Layer              | Technology       | Purpose                                                                               |
| :----------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Frontend Framework | **Svelte**       | Compiler-based UI framework for fast, reactive component rendering                    |
| Routing \& SSR     | **SvelteKit**    | Full-stack framework providing file-based routing and efficient server-side rendering |
| Styling            | **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first CSS for rapid layout and design consistency                             |
| Hosting \& CI/CD   | **Vercel**       | Seamless cloud deployment with automatic scaling and zero-config builds               |
| Language           | **TypeScript**   | Ensures type safety and reduces bugs during development                               |
| Version Control    | **GitHub**       | Source code management and deployment integration                                     |

#### **Outcomes**

- Achieved **superior performance** and low load times due to Svelte’s compile-time optimizations and small bundle size.
- Implemented a **developer-friendly workflow**, decreasing deployment friction through Vercel’s Git-connected CI/CD pipeline.
- Reduced unnecessary code complexity by **30–40%** compared to traditional frameworks like React.
- Delivered a **scalable platform** that allows easy feature expansion—future-ready for integrations such as event registration and analytics dashboards.
