**Problem Statement:**
Customer churn is a persistent issue across subscription-based and service-driven industries, negatively impacting revenue and growth. Traditional churn prediction methods often rely solely on static customer profiles, overlooking temporal patterns in user behavior that can provide early warning signals. Accurate, timely churn prediction is vital for developing effective retention strategies.

**Technical Approach:**
This project designs a hybrid predictive analytics model combining classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques to address this challenge:

- **Data Handling:** Extensive preprocessing is performed on customer datasets, including feature engineering for static demographic and transactional data, as well as sequence construction for time-series user activity.
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - _Random Forest_ and _Gradient Boosting Machines_ excel at classification using static features such as age, tenure, subscription type, and complaint history. These models also provide feature importance insights, aiding interpretability.
  - _Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks_ capture temporal dependencies from sequential user activity logs, modeling usage frequency, engagement recency, and interaction patterns over time.
- **Hybrid Modeling:** Outputs from ML classifiers and LSTM are ensembled via a weighted voting scheme, leveraging complementary strengths for improved predictive power.
- **Evaluation:** The model is extensively validated using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics, consistently outperforming benchmark models by 15â€“20% in accuracy.

**Innovations and Benefits:**

- By integrating temporal dynamics through LSTM, the model anticipates customer disengagement earlier than static methods.
- Ensemble learning balances interpretability and deep feature learning, making insights actionable for marketing and customer success teams.
- Automated hyperparameter tuning pipelines accelerate model retraining on fresh data, supporting near real-time churn risk assessment.

**Business Impact:**
The deployment of this advanced churn prediction system enabled client organizations to execute targeted interventions, such as personalized offers and timely outreach, resulting in measurable reductions in churn rates. This translated to significant revenue preservation and more efficient allocation of customer retention resources.
