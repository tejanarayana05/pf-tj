### Restaurant Management System

**Tech Stack:** Svelte, Python, Flask, Epson POS Module

#### Overview

Developed a robust, full-stack restaurant management system designed to modernize operations for dine-in and takeout businesses. The application features a dynamic Svelte frontend for fast, interactive user experiences paired with a Python Flask backend for reliable API management and order processing. The integration with Epson POS printers using the dedicated Epson POS module enables seamless, automated receipt and order slip printing directly from the application, ensuring smooth hand-offs to kitchen and front-desk staff.

#### Key Features

- **Order Management:** Real-time food order placement, tracking, and status updating for customers and staff through a responsive web interface.
- **Printer Integration:** Direct connection to Epson POS printers allows instant, formatted printing of receipts and kitchen tickets, reducing manual intervention and order errors.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Centralized dashboard for managing food menu items, prices, staff user access, and tracking daily sales.
- **Seamless Communication:** RESTful Flask backend APIs ensure secure and efficient data flow between frontend and backend, while enabling external integrations (e.g., inventory or analytics modules) for business scalability.
- **User Experience:** Built with a focus on mobile responsiveness and user-friendliness for both staff and customers, with intuitive navigation, quick ordering, and robust error handling.

#### Impact \& Outcomes

- Reduced order processing time by automating communication between web app and kitchen through Epson POS.
- Successfully deployed a system capable of handling high transaction volume, minimizing bottlenecks during service peaks.
- Enhanced order accuracy, eliminated redundant manual steps, and created a scalable architecture adaptable for future modules such as reservation or customer loyalty.
