### Recap: Nidhi-Anveshan at SITAR-2K23 Techno and Cultural Fest

Hello everyone!

I’m thrilled to share the incredible success of the recent **Nidhi-Anveshan** event held on March 10, 2023, as part of the **SITAR-2K23 TECHNO AND CULTURAL FEST**. Hosting an event amidst such a vibrant and bustling fest was challenging, but the experience was immensely rewarding.

We had around 120 enthusiastic participants from all branches, which made the event lively and engaging. Coordinating an event of this scale during a busy fest required not just planning but seamless teamwork, and I couldn’t have done it without my amazing team and coordinators. Their dedication and support played a crucial role in making this event a great success.

A special thanks to my friends [Vamsi Saripudi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vamsi-saripudi-a3051b1b6/), [Tummalapalli Dinesh Narayan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dinesh-narayan/), and [Sonti Venkat Sai Karthik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonti-venkat-sai-karthik/) for their unwavering coordination support. I am also deeply grateful to my faculty mentors, V Rajesh sir and [Swapna Donepudi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swapna-donepudi-8a100a4/), whose invaluable guidance inspired us throughout the preparation and execution phases.

This event was not just a competition but a celebration of innovation, collaboration, and enthusiasm among students. It reminded me that success comes from collective effort, resilience, and the spirit of community. Looking forward to many more such opportunities to learn, lead, and grow together!
