### A Moment of Pride: APSCHE Excellence Awards 2024

There are moments in life that remind you that every bit of effort, every late night, every small act of kindness and leadership truly matters. For me, one such moment arrived when I was shortlisted for the **Influential Student Award** at the **APSCHE Excellence Awards 2024**. Out of thousands of applications received from across the state, I was one of the twelve students chosen a recognition that felt both humbling and surreal.

This award celebrated not just academic ambition, but something deeper **leadership, community involvement, and the ability to create impact through influence**. To be recognized for qualities that truly define who I strive to be every day was incredibly rewarding. I’ve always believed that being a student is not just about learning from books but about learning from people listening, contributing, and being part of something larger than yourself.

The journey to this moment wasn’t sudden. It was built over the years—through college initiatives, projects, and community engagements that shaped my perspective. Whether it was leading small teams in cultural events, volunteering for student-driven causes, or simply being there for my peers when they needed someone to talk to each experience became a small part of something greater. I discovered that influence isn’t about popularity; it’s about presence. It’s about being the person who motivates others to believe in themselves, who lifts people up, and sets an example through everyday actions.

When I received the news of being shortlisted, I felt a wave of emotions - joy, pride, and above all, gratitude. Gratitude to my mentors who guided me, my friends who always believed in me, and my family who reminded me that impact begins with kindness and consistency. It wasn’t just about holding a title; it was about realizing that the values I lived by helping others, staying curious, being resilient—were seen and valued by others too.

Being among the top 12 students from across the state was more than an achievement; it was a reflection of growth. I understood that leadership isn’t about always having the right answers, it’s about asking the right questions and acting with purpose. It reaffirmed my belief that a single person can create ripples of change in their surroundings—one initiative, one conversation, one idea at a time.

Today, this milestone stands as a reminder of how far I’ve come from being a student trying to find a voice to becoming someone who uses it to inspire others. The APSCHE Excellence Awards 2024 will always remain a proud chapter in my journey, a chapter that reminds me to keep striving, keep giving, and keep believing that influence starts with intention.
